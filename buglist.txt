Bugs:
Enqueue: There was a bug while enqueuing more than one value, it was adding an element to the front of the queue not the back.
This cause peekfront to not return the correct value. It was getting the value from the back of the queue.
It also caused dequeue to not work properly. It would would remove from the back, instead of the front.

Destructor: When I ran Valgrind, there were memory leaks.
It didn't properly deallocate all of the values.
There were 18 allocs, 10 frees. This was due to the bug in enqueue.

Dequeue Documentation: Not a bug but in the return method it says that it returns the value of the entry at the front of the queue.
But dequeue doesn't return anything since it's a void function.
